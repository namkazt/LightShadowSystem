# LightShadowSystem - Not working with cocos2dx any more

A new light and shadow system shader-based for cocos2d-x, 
it is the part of cocos2dx-lite (https://github.com/c0i/cocos2dx-lite)

![Demo](https://github.com/namkazt/LightShadowSystem/blob/master/shadown.gif "demo shadow")

[WIP]
I will update source code when it done.
